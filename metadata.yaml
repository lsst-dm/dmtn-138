description: "In order to better support agility and management of third-party dependencies, reduce conflicts when compiling the stack on new and older systems, simplify distribution releases and installation of builds, we propose switching to conda-forge for managing third-party dependencies and adopting the conda compiler, the adoption of several new conda recipes, and some small changes to eups and the lsst-build system."
